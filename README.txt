Division of Work:
James: I created the dashboard page (dashboard.py, status.py), see a friend (seefriends.c/seefriends.cgi), and the profile generator helper program for seefriends, implemented in "profile.py." 

Samuel: I created the welcome page, login and registration page, and make a friend page. The associated back-end programs are the register.cgi, login.cgi, makeafriend.py and newfriends.py. 

Note that the login.cgi and register.cgi sometimes encounter 500 internal errors. This has been explored thoroughly and a solution has not been found. The errors are seemingly random and can be overcome by refreshing the page. The programs will work when the server lets it through.
